# FaceRecognition
This project is a face recognition application that recognizes certain images. The images are downloaded in png format and added to a separate directory. When the program is run, a webcam opens up and compares the visible faces with the images in the separate directory. It then returns with a match prediction and accuracy. I used modules like face_recognition, cv2, numpy, math, sys, and os.
